I don't see any substantial tariff or trade policy developments in today's headlines. The data includes geopolitical news about US-Israel strikes on Iran, general business stories, and some government trade office updates, but lacks the specific tariff actions, trade negotiations, or policy announcements needed for a comprehensive trade briefing.

The most relevant trade-related items are:

**Limited Trade Developments**

The US Trade Representative's office is [seeking comment](https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2026/february/ustr-seeks-public-comment-design-plurilateral-agreement-trade-critical-minerals-and-policy-actions) on designing a plurilateral agreement for critical minerals trade and supply chain resilience policies. This follows recent praise for a [US-Indonesia deal](https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2026/february/us-indonesia-deal-draws-praise-american-farmers-and-industry-leaders) from American farmers and industry groups, though specific details of the agreement remain unclear.
