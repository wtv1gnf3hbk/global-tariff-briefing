The Supreme Court has struck down President Trump's tariff program, creating a significant shift in US trade policy. The [Court ruled](https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2026/february/ambassador-greer-issues-statement-supreme-court-ieepa-decision) that Trump overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when imposing the levies. This opens the door for companies like [FedEx to seek](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly83r1njjro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) tariff refunds, while BNY strategists say the Treasury will likely [issue more T-bills](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/us-can-sell-more-t-bills-to-offset-lost-tariff-revenue-bny-says) to offset lost tariff revenue.

Despite the legal setback, Trump has implemented a new [global 10% tariff](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6zn3ly22yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) that applies to most countries, including the EU and UK. This rate is lower than the 15% Trump had threatened over the weekend. The move [spares European exporters](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-spares-eu-uk-higher-global-tariff-rates-trade-deal/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&#038;utm_medium=RSS&#038;utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication) from higher rates for now, though UK officials warn Britain could be among the worst hit by the new levies.

**Tariff Actions & Retaliation**

**Market & Economic Impact**

• The Treasury is expected to [issue additional T-bills](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/us-can-sell-more-t-bills-to-offset-lost-tariff-revenue-bny-says) to compensate for lost tariff revenue following the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Trump's original tariff program

• Companies affected by the overturned tariffs can now seek refunds, with [FedEx filing suit](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly83r1njjro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) to recover payments made under the now-invalidated program
