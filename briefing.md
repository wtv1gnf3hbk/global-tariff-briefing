The European Union moved forward with provisional implementation of its long-delayed trade agreement with South America's Mercosur bloc, overriding parliamentary opposition. The [EU decision](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/eu-forges-ahead-with-mercosur-trade-deal-in-provisional-step) marks a significant step toward creating one of the world's largest free trade zones, covering over 700 million people across Europe and South America.

Meanwhile, the US Trade Representative opened public comment on designing a new plurilateral agreement focused on critical minerals trade. The [USTR initiative](https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2026/february/ustr-seeks-public-comment-design-plurilateral-agreement-trade-critical-minerals-and-policy-actions) seeks to strengthen supply chain resilience for materials essential to clean energy and technology sectors. American farmers and industry leaders praised a separate US-Indonesia trade deal, though specific terms remain under wraps.

**Tariff Actions & Retaliation**

• The EU provisionally [implemented](https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-implements-eu-mercosur-trade-deal/) the Mercosur trade agreement despite lacking formal European Parliament approval, eliminating tariffs on billions in agricultural and manufactured goods between Europe and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

• USTR seeks input on [critical minerals](https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2026/february/ustr-seeks-public-comment-design-plurilateral-agreement-trade-critical-minerals-and-policy-actions) trade agreement design, targeting supply chain vulnerabilities in lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements essential for batteries and semiconductors.

**Trade Negotiations & Diplomacy**

• Brussels [moved ahead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/eu-forges-ahead-with-mercosur-trade-deal-in-provisional-step) with Mercosur implementation as a "provisional step" while the controversial agreement faces European Parliament review over environmental and agricultural concerns.

• American agricultural groups [endorsed](https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2026/february/us-indonesia-deal-draws-praise-american-farmers-and-industry-leaders) the recent US-Indonesia trade deal, signaling expanded market access for US farm products in Southeast Asia's largest economy.

**Market & Economic Impact**

• The S&P 500 faces its first monthly loss in February as AI bubble concerns and technology sector volatility drive [investors toward](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/fast-money-funds-ditch-us-stocks-for-safe-havens-as-jitters-rise) safer assets including Treasuries.

• Oil prices gained on [US-Iran talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/latest-oil-market-news-and-analysis-for-feb-26) resuming next week, while Middle East military deployments maintain market tension over potential supply disruptions.
