A landmark week in global trade policy began with the US Supreme Court striking down President Trump's emergency tariffs, sending ripples across multiple trade relationships. The [court ruling](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-23/india-gains-leverage-in-us-trade-talks-after-court-verdict) has given India more leverage in bilateral trade negotiations, while prompting the EU to hit pause on its own trade deal ratification process with Washington.

Trump quickly responded by announcing new [15% global tariffs](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8z48xwqn3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) to replace the struck-down emergency measures.
